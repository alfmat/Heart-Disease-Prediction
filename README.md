## Inspiration
I have always been interested in the unique intersection between technology and health care. I believe there is a lot of potential in using statistical learning methods for analyzing medical data. After learning Linear and Logistic Regression techniques, I have applied them to some of the datasets. 

## Sources
Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, 

University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland

University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland

V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation

## Findings
* I developed a Logisitic Regression model that can predict with 80% accuracy the type of angiographic disease that a patient has (Notebooks/Heart-Analysis).


## Techniques that will be used:
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that analyze various datasets from the Town of Chapel Hill.
